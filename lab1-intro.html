    <h1>Welcome to my first HTML webpage</h1>

    <p>In this web programming course I am currently learning about HTML, the foundationational language used to create webpages. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it structures the content on the web by using tags. These different tags help define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. This allows you to organize and display information on a webpage. Understanding how to properly use these tags is crucial to building a well-structured website. </p>

    <p>I am also currently learning about <strong>attributes</strong>. Attributes modify the behavior or the appearance of elements. An example of this is the src attribute in an image tag. This specifies the images location, while the href attribute defines the URL that the user will go to when they click on the link. These basics give you tools to start creating a basic functional webpage.</p>
