    <h1>About Lab 2</h1>

    <p>In this lab, students will design a simple HTML page that includes a table showcasing links to various resources. Absolute paths will be used to link to external websites, such as Github.com. Relative paths will create connections to internal pages within the same project directory. Through this exercise, students will practice writing clean and functional HTML code. This activity helps build an understanding of web navigation and the distinction between relative and absolute paths.</p>
